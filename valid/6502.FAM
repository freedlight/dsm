6502 family differences
-----------------------

We differentiate 4 families within the 6502 line:
	6502 - plain vanilla
	6501 - Rockwell enhanced commands
	65C00 - Rockwell enhanced commands, with some added CMOS functions
	65C02 - GTE and others
		including 65C151

------------------
Opcode differences
------------------

1) 6501 and 65C00 subfamilies: the opcodes x7 and xF are all valid

2) 65C00 and 65C02 subfamilies : the following opcodes are valid
		5A 7A DA FA
		80
3) 65C02 subfamily: the following opcodes are valid
		04 0C
		12 14 1A 1C
		32 34 3A 3C
		52
		64
		72 74 7C
		89
		92 9C 9E
		B2
		D2
		F2
4) 65C00 subfamily: the opcode 02 is valid

-----------------------
Source code differences
-----------------------

1) 6501 and 65C00 subfamilies:
	the source code SMBx, RMBx, BBSx, and BBRx (x=0 to 7) are all valid

2) 65C00 and 65C02 subfamilies:
	the source codes BRA, PHY, PLY, PHX, and PLX are valid

3) 65C02 subfamily:
	the source codes TSB, TRB, and STZ (or CLR) are valid
	in addition, the following address modes are added to existing codes:
		ORA (indirect)
		AND (indirect)
		EOR (indirect)
		ADC (indirect)
		STA (indirect)
		LDA (indirect)
		CMP (indirect)
		SBC (indirect)
		INC (accumulator)
		DEC (accumulator)
		JMP (indirect,X)
		BIT (zeropage,X)
		BIT (indexed,X)
		BIT (immediate)

4) 65C00 subfamily:
	the source code MUL is valid
